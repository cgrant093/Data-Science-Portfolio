Compile the java files. 

The main function is in Prog5 
(Program 5 b/c it was the 5th project of the semester).

Needs to be ran with a file that has at least one set of
viable "Appointment" data. 
I have a test file with this under the name 'test_app.txt'.

After loading in this, or other, appointment files, 
the program should run, and a GUI should pop up where you can
Add or Delete an Appointment or Calendar
Search a Calendar for an Appointment based on time or its name.
