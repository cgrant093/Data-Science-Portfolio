# Skills-Portfolio
Brief overview of my knowledge and skills that are useful in data science, software development, and similar fields. 

Skills and projects are separated by language. Python being the most in-depth due to a combination of experience and relevance:
1. Python
    * Machine Learning (sklearn, numpy, PyTorch)
    * Statistical Tests (numpy, pandas, scipy, statsmodels)
    * Pandas DataFrame manipulation (pandas)
    * Webscraping (requests)
    * Unit Testing (pytest)
    * GUIs (pyqt5)
    * Quantum Computing and QML (Pennylane)
2. SQL
3. LaTeX
4. Java
5. C++
6. Mathematica
7. Other Skills/Languages:
    * MATLAB, Excel, AWS, Quantum Machine Learning, Command Prompt



## Python
Python was self-taught along side simple neural network developement in 2017. My development experience with Python is predominately my personal projects and one of my research projects during my PhD, some of which can be found in this and other repositories found on my Github.

One of my respositories, [Valorant Data Project](https://github.com/cgrant093/Valorant-Data-Project), covers many of my skills in python: webscraping with requests, organizing/cleaning data in pandas dataframes, aggregating and graphing data, and feature selection for supervised model training. The future developments will involve some combination of the following: classical or deep learning model training, hypothesis testing (ANOVA), and unit testing. A more detailed description can be found [here](https://github.com/cgrant093/Valorant-Data-Project).


### Machine Learning 
For notable projects using supervised machine learning algorithms in python, please check the following repositories:
* [Valorant Data Project](https://github.com/cgrant093/Valorant-Data-Project): classification_models.ipynb is studying which sklearn classification model is best for the specific features selected
* [Handwritten Recognition](https://github.com/cgrant093/Handwritten-Recognition): has two projects of note, 
   * Simple_NN uses numpy to create a handwritten digit reader. This was my first ML and python project back in 2017
   * Handwrote_Word_Reader uses PyTorch to create a handwritten word reader utilizing CNNs, bidirectional LSTM RNNs, and a CTC

In this repository, in the Python/[Machine Learning](https://github.com/cgrant093/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Python/Machine%20Learning) subfolder:
* regression_models: compares simple sklearn regression ML models on a randomly generated dataset
* classification_models: compares simple sklearn classification model on a randomly generated dataset
* midi_composer_classifier: trying to classify midi data to a known set of composers and there are three files that do not belong to our known list of composers.

I also have a [published paper](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1771848) from one of my PhD research projects. It utilizes neural networks (utilizing mostly numpy) as unbiased, non-linear regressors. This project also generates the (training) pseudo-data from experimental measurements using a Monte Carlo algorithm.


### Statistical tests
In the Python/[Statistical Methods](https://github.com/cgrant093/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Python/Statistical%20Methods) subfolder, the file [hypothesis_testing](https://github.com/cgrant093/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Python/Statistical%20Methods/hypothesis_testing.ipynb) uses a few different versions of t-tests, ANOVA tests, and chi-squared tests on a dataFrame I created. The file used to create the fake dataFrame and the csv file is located in the same subfolder.


### Pandas DataFrame manipulation
### Webscraping
### Unit testing
### GUIs
### Quantum Computing and QML



## SQL



## LaTeX
I have been using LaTeX during my entire grad school career. I have become very fluent in this 'language'.

I have helped write several research papers, whch can be found in my resume. Much of my grad school homework was written in LaTex; as well as, my dissertation and its defense slides, and my resume were all constructed using it. As well as any supplimentary PDFs found in the other folders. I have added my LaTex code for my resume and defense in the LaTeX folder. 


## Java
I primarily used Java in undergrad, specifically in classes CS101 and CS102, and it was the main language used for my undergraduate thesis.

My undergrad thesis has been added to the Java/[Undergrad_Thesis](https://github.com/cgrant093/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Java/Undergrad_Thesis) subfolder. The readme in this folder goes into detail, but I beg forgiveness from whomever looks at this code. It was early in my coding career and the inexperience shows.

The other project is a the final project I did for CS-102 back in 2016. There were 5 main projects for this class and all of them were a calendar application. Each time, the requirements for the application would become more strict/complex or change. The main addition for this final version was adding a GUI using JFrame as opposed to the user inferfacing with the command prompt. It was the first project were the whole coding process finally clicked for me.


## C++
My main experience with C++ comes from a class I took my first year of grad school, Computers in High Energy Physics, or something along those lines. The class started as if you didn't know and C++ and then quickly moved along to applications. I felt I was quick to learn C++ with my previous Java experience. This concept I've felt has been more true every language I pick up because it is more or less a difference in syntax, but I digress. 

The Cpp/[6860](https://github.com/cgrant093/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Cpp/6860) subfolder holds the small projects and coding notes taken for this class. The class also went into learning some terminal commands.

The final project, which I collaborated with 2 other students, can be found in this shared [repository](https://github.com/imooney/relativistic-resonance-decays).


## Mathematica

A large majority of my grad school research was performed using Mathematica. Some of these files can be found in the Mathematica subfolder. Start to finish, they can probably show a large developement in my coding skills as this was the primary language I used during my grad school. These were also the years where I felt my coding skills become greatly refined from what they were in undergrad.
